CHOCOGUIDE

This project is dedicated to all people in San Francisco who love chocolate.


Find the chocolate shops around your area by using a relevant zip code. Access shop's name, address, Yelp rating and Yelp webite 
by clicking on a map marker. Mark the shop you liked by clicking on the heart icon.

================================================
Created using mostly vanilla JavaScript, a bit of jquery to make AJAX call, Yelp API, Google Maps, Google Maps Geocoding API and local storage (liked shops are stored locally within the user's browser).
