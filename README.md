CHOCOGUIDE

This project is dedicated to all people in San Francisco who love chocolate just as I do :)


Find the chocolate/candy shops around your area by using a relevant zip code. Access shop's name, address, Yelp rating and Yelp webite 
by clicking on a map marker. Save the shop you liked by clicking on the heart icon.
